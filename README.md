# What’s with the Cross?

**Q:** Why did Jesus allow Himself to be crucified? And how did His self-subjection to crucifixion accomplish those ends?

**A:** According to the Scriptures, Jesus submitted Himself to execution to once and for all fulfill the guilt and sin offering portions of the Law[^1][^2] and thus offer our minds, [without](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A32%2C3%3A20%2C5%3A12%2C6%3A16%2C6%3A21%2C7%3A7%2C8%3A6%2C8%3A13%2CGalatians%206%3A8%3B%201%20Corinthians%2011%3A26&version=NASB) any morally deforming soft-pedaling of the gravity of our sin, [liberation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2020%3A28%2C%20Mark%2010%3A45%2C%20Galatians%201%3A4%2C%201%20Timothy%202%3A6%2C%20Titus%202%3A14%2C%20Exodus%2012%3A1-34&version=NASB) from guilt toward God and any further obligation to try to make concrete [amends](https://github.com/scottstilson/amends) with Him.

In light of His generous sacrifice, the New Testament also claims that Jesus laid down His life to inspire grateful devotion to Him, thereby offering our minds a second emancipation, this one [out of the naturally self-serving and people-pleasing patterns of the world and into adoption as His people in His kingdom](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:28,%20Romans%2014:7-9,%201%20Corinthians%206:20,%207:23%3B%202%20Corinthians%205:14-15,%205:20-21%3B%20Galatians%201:4,%202:20-21,%206:14-16%3B%20Ephesians%205:25-26%3B%20Colossians%201:13,%201:24%3B%201%20Thessalonians%205:9-11%3B%20Titus%202:11-15%3B%20Hebrews%209:14,%2010:10,%2012:2,%2013:11-14%3B%201%20Peter%201:18-21,%202:18-25,%20Revelation%205:9-12&version=NASB), where obedience to Him and [the Father](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:17-18,%2014:29-31,%2018:11%3B%20Romans%206:10%3B%20Philippians%202:5-8%3B%20Hebrews%205:8&version=NASB), very often taking the form of unglamorous, servant-hearted, sometimes cruciform acts of love for others, is the rule.

N.B. There’s [strong suggestion in the New Testament](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:26-27,%202%20Peter%202:20-22&version=NASB) that our continuance in the freedom from guilt that Jesus’ sacrifice supplies depends on our continuance of efforts toward maintaining this second, derivative freedom from selfishness and the world. [Not, it must be noted, that we need to maintain sinlessness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201%3A6-2%3A2%2C%20Psalm%2032%3A5%2C%20Proverbs%2028%3A13%2C%20James%203%3A2&version=NASB).

Finally and relatedly, the Bible indicates Jesus allowed Himself to be killed to establish the basic temporal precondition for His resurrection, a miracle that reinforces our mind’s deliverance from one kingdom to the other by validating Jesus’ status as God’s chosen one, worthy of our utmost allegiance,[^3][^4] and by [freeing us from the fear of death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%202%3A14-18%2C%20Colossians%201%3A5&version=NASB), which is [a hindrance to following Him](https://www.thefaithlog.com/2018/05/whereupon-all-sinned.html).
